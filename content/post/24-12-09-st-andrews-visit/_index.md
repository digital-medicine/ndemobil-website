Dr. Lara Marie Reimer visited the School of Medicine of the University of St. Andrews as part of the official delegation of the University Hospital Bonn. They discussed potential collaborations in research and education.
The visit was very insightful and we hope to establish an ongoing cooperation between our research group and the University of St. Andrews.
