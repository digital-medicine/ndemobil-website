NDEmobil held it's first retreat in Vienna in May of this year. All current team members (Dr. rer. nat. Lara Marie Reimer, Leon Nissen, Florian Schweizer, Yifan Yang, Fabian Kahl, and Petra Weiss) joined the trip. They explored the city, had typical "Wiener Schnitzel" and attended the dHealth conference, at which a paper by Schweizer et al. was presented as a poster.
