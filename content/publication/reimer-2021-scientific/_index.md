abstract: 'Background: Mobile apps may encourage a lifestyle that avoids unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking or poor nutrition, which promotes cardiovascular diseases ({CVD}). Yet, little data is available on the utilization, perception, and long-term effects of such apps to prevent {CVD}. Objectives: To develop a mobile app concept to reduce the individual {CVD} risk and collect information addressing research questions on {CVD} prevention while preserving data privacy and security. Methods: To validate the concept, a prototype will be built, and usability studies will be performed. Results: We expect to determine whether it is possible to reach a broad user base and to collect scientific information while protecting user data sufficiently. Conclusion: To address {CVD} prevention, we propose a mobile coaching app. We expect high acceptance rates in validation studies.'
