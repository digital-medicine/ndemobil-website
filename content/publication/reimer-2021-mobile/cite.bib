	abstract = {Background: Physical activity helps improve the overall quality of life. The correct execution of physical activity is crucial both in sports as well as disease prevention and rehabilitation. Little to no automated commodity solutions for automated analysis and feedback exist. Objectives: Validation of the Apple {ARKit} framework as a solution for automatic body tracking in daily physical exercises using the smartphones’ built-in camera. Methods: We deliver insights into {ARKit}’s body tracking accuracy through a lab experiment against the {VICON} system as Gold Standard. We provide further insights through case studies using apps built on {ARKit}. Results: {ARKit} exposes significant limitations in tracking the full range of motion in joints but accurately tracks the movement itself. Case studies show that applying it to measure the quantity of execution of exercises is possible. Conclusion: {ARKit} is a light-weight commodity solution for quantitative assessment of physical activity. Its limitations and possibilities in qualitative assessment need to be investigated further.},
