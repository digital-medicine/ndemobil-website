	abstract = {Background: Mobile apps may encourage a lifestyle that avoids unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking or poor nutrition, which promotes cardiovascular diseases ({CVD}). Yet, little data is available on the utilization, perception, and long-term effects of such apps to prevent {CVD}. Objectives: To develop a mobile app concept to reduce the individual {CVD} risk and collect information addressing research questions on {CVD} prevention while preserving data privacy and security. Methods: To validate the concept, a prototype will be built, and usability studies will be performed. Results: We expect to determine whether it is possible to reach a broad user base and to collect scientific information while protecting user data sufficiently. Conclusion: To address {CVD} prevention, we propose a mobile coaching app. We expect high acceptance rates in validation studies.},

	abstract = {Background: There is an increased need for physical activity among children and adolescents. {KIJANI}, a mobile augmented reality game, is designed to increase physical activity through gamified exercises. Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to get feedback on the design and implementation of potentially physical activity-increasing features in {KIJANI}. Methods: A mixed-method study (n=13) evaluates newly implemented game design features quantitatively through measuring physical activity and qualitatively through participant feedback. Results: Preliminary results are limited and need further studies. Participants’ feedback shows a positive trend and highlights the game’s potential effectiveness. Conclusion: {KIJANI} shows potential for increasing physical activity among children and adolescents through gamified exercise. Future work will refine the game based on user feedback and findings presented in related work. The game’s long-term impact is to be explored.},

	shorttitle = {{mBalance}},
	abstract = {Background: Postural imbalance can be adopted for the early detection of age-related diseases or monitoring the course of the disease treatment; especially in monitoring, frequent balance measurement is crucial. This is mainly done through regular in-person examinations by a physician currently. Feedback in between examinations is often missing. Objectives: This paper proposes {mBalance}, a mobile application that uses the Romberg test to detect postural imbalance. {mBalance} provides a camera-based, low-cost approach to measure imbalance frequently at home using mobile devices. Methods: Imbalance detection accuracy and usability was evaluated in two separate studies with 31 and 30 participants, respectively. Results: {mBalance} correctly detected imbalance with a sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 87\%. The study found good usability with no significant problems. Conclusion: Overall, this study solves the problem of postural imbalance detection by digitizing a validated balance test into an easy-to-use mobile application.},
