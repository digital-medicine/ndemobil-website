	abstract = {Computer-vision-based frameworks enable markerless human motion capture on consumer-grade devices in real-time. They open up new possibilities for application, such as in the health and medical sector. So far, research on mobile solutions has been focused on 2-dimensional motion capture frameworks. 2D motion analysis is limited by the viewing angle of the positioned camera. New frameworks enable 3-dimensional human motion capture and can be supported through additional smartphone sensors such as {LiDAR}. 3D motion capture promises to overcome the limitations of 2D frameworks by considering all three movement planes independent of the camera angle. In this study, we performed a laboratory experiment with ten subjects, comparing the joint angles in eight different body-weight exercises tracked by Apple {ARKit}, a mobile 3D motion capture framework, against a gold-standard system for motion capture: the Vicon system. The 3D motion capture framework exposed a weighted Mean Absolute Error of 18.80° ± 12.12° (ranging from 3.75° ± 0.99° to 47.06° ± 5.11° per tracked joint angle and exercise) and a Mean Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient of 0.76 for the whole data set. The data set shows a high variance of those two metrics between the observed angles and performed exercises. The observed accuracy is influenced by the visibility of the joints and the observed motion. While the 3D motion capture framework is a promising technology that could enable several use cases in the entertainment, health, and medical area, its limitations should be considered for each potential application area.},

	abstract = {Background
              Identifying high-risk individuals is crucial for preventing cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}). Currently, risk assessment is mostly performed by physicians. Mobile health apps could help decouple the determination of risk from medical resources by allowing unrestricted self-assessment. The respective test results need to be interpretable for laypersons.
            
            
              Objective
              Together with a patient organization, we aimed to design a digital risk calculator that allows people to individually assess and optimize their {CVD} risk. The risk calculator was integrated into the mobile health app {HerzFit}, which provides the respective background information.
            
            
              Methods
              To cover a broad spectrum of individuals for both primary and secondary prevention, we integrated the respective scores (Framingham 10-year {CVD}, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 in Older Persons, and Secondary Manifestations Of Arterial Disease) into a single risk calculator that was recalibrated for the German population. In primary prevention, an individual’s heart age is estimated, which gives the user an easy-to-understand metric for assessing cardiac health. For secondary prevention, the risk of recurrence was assessed. In addition, a comparison of expected to mean and optimal risk levels was determined. The risk calculator is available free of charge. Data safety is ensured by processing the data locally on the users’ smartphones.
            
            
              Results
              Offering a risk calculator to the general population requires the use of multiple instruments, as each provides only a limited spectrum in terms of age and risk distribution. The integration of 4 internationally recommended scores allows risk calculation in individuals aged 30 to 90 years with and without {CVD}. Such integration requires recalibration and harmonization to provide consistent and plausible estimates. In the first 14 months after the launch, the {HerzFit} calculator was downloaded more than 96,000 times, indicating great demand. Public information campaigns proved effective in publicizing the risk calculator and contributed significantly to download numbers.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The {HerzFit} calculator provides {CVD} risk assessment for the general population. The public demonstrated great demand for such a risk calculator as it was downloaded up to 10,000 times per month, depending on campaigns creating awareness for the instrument.},

	abstract = {Objective
              In Germany, only a few standardized evaluation tools for assessing the usability of mobile Health apps exist so far. This study aimed to translate and validate the English patient version for standalone apps of the {mHealth} App Usability Questionnaire ({MAUQ}) into a German version.
            
            
              Methods
              Following scientific guidelines for translation and cross-cultural adaptation, the patient version for standalone apps was forward and back-translated from English into German by an expert panel. In total, 53 participants who were recruited as part of the beta testing process of the recently developed {mHealth} app {HerzFit}, answered the questions of the German version of the {MAUQ} ({GER}-{MAUQ}) and the System Usability Scale. Subsequently, a descriptive as well as a psychometric analysis was performed to test validity and reliability.
            
            
              Results
              After conducting three cognitive interviews, five items were modified. The values for Cronbach alpha for the entire questionnaire and the three subscales (0.966, 0.814, 0.910, and 0.909) indicate strong internal consistency. The correlation analysis revealed that the scores of the {GER}-{MAUQ}, the subscales and the {SUS} were strongly correlated with each other. The correlation coefficient of the {SUS} and the {GER}-{MAUQ} overall score was r = 0.854, P {\textless} 0.001 and the coefficients of the subscales and the {SUS} were r = 0.642, P {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.866, P {\textless} 0.001 and r = 0.643, P {\textless} 0.001.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We have developed a novel German version of the {MAUQ} and demonstrated it as a reliable and valid measurement tool for assessing the usability of standalone {mHealth} apps from the patients’ perspective. The {GER}-{MAUQ} allows a new form of standardized assessment of usability of {mHealth} apps for patients with cardiovascular disease in Germany. Further research with a larger sample and other samples is recommended.},

	abstract = {Background
              Mobile health ({mHealth}) apps can be used for cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) prevention. User-centered design, evidence-based content and user testing can be applied to ensure a high level of usability and adequate app access.
            
            
              Objective
              To develop and evaluate an {mHealth} app ( {HerzFit}) for {CVD} prevention.
            
            
              Methods
              {HerzFit}´s development included a user-centered design approach and guideline-based content creation based on the identified requirements of the target group. Beta testing and a preliminary usability evaluation of the {HerzFit} prototype were performed. For evaluation, German versions of the System Usability Scale ({SUS}) and the {mHealth} App Usability Questionnaire ({GER}-{MAUQ}) as well as free text feedback were applied.
            
            
              Results
              User-centered design thinking led to the definition of four personas. Based on their requirements, {HerzFit} enables users to individually assess, monitor, and optimize their cardiovascular risk profile. Users are also provided with a variety of evidence-based information on {CVD} and their risk factors. The user interface and system design followed the identified functional requirements. Beta-testers provided feedback on the structure and functionality and rated the usability of {HerzFit}´s prototype as slightly above average both in {SUS} and {GER}-{MAUQ} rating. Participants positively noted the variety of functions and information presented in {HerzFit}, while negative feedback mostly concerned wearable synchronization.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The present study demonstrates the user-centered development of a guideline-based {mHealth} app for {CVD} prevention. Beta-testing and a preliminary usability study were used to further improve the {HerzFit} app until its official release.},

	abstract = {Objective Digital approaches have the potential to make activity promotion attractive and age-appropriate for children and adolescents. {KIJANI} is a mobile application aiming to increase physical activity ({PA}) in youth via gamification and augmented reality. This study investigates the user experience with {KIJANI} through a multimethod approach. Approaches {KIJANI} is based on the concept that virtual coins can be earned through {PA}, for example, in the form of collected step counts. With these coins, blocks can be bought, which can be used to create virtual buildings and landscapes and integrate these into the player's real-world environment via augmented reality. To evaluate the user experience, participants played {KIJANI} in groups of three for 25 min. Afterwards {KIJANI} was evaluated qualitatively with one-on-one semi-structured interviews as well as quantitatively with standardized questionnaires. Results Overall, 22 participants (12.6 ± 1.7 years, 6 girls) were included in the study. The overall game concept and realization were well received by the target group. Study participants did have various and creative ideas for the further development of {KIJANI}. The majority ( n = 16) thought that using {KIJANI} would increase their {PA} level. User experience based on the {UEQ} scale was (mean ± {SD}): attractiveness (1.78 ± 1.82), perspicuity (2.15 ± 0.680), efficiency (0.67 ± 1.25), dependability, (1.21 ± 0.93), stimulation (1.24 ± 1.78), and novelty (1.27 ± 1.34). Conclusion With these insights, a further step has been taken in the participatory development of {KIJANI}. Apps like {KIJANI} appear to be suitable for {PA} promotion in children and adolescents.},
