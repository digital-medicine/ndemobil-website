	abstract = {Objective Digital approaches have the potential to make activity promotion attractive and age-appropriate for children and adolescents. {KIJANI} is a mobile application aiming to increase physical activity ({PA}) in youth via gamification and augmented reality. This study investigates the user experience with {KIJANI} through a multimethod approach. Approaches {KIJANI} is based on the concept that virtual coins can be earned through {PA}, for example, in the form of collected step counts. With these coins, blocks can be bought, which can be used to create virtual buildings and landscapes and integrate these into the player's real-world environment via augmented reality. To evaluate the user experience, participants played {KIJANI} in groups of three for 25 min. Afterwards {KIJANI} was evaluated qualitatively with one-on-one semi-structured interviews as well as quantitatively with standardized questionnaires. Results Overall, 22 participants (12.6 ± 1.7 years, 6 girls) were included in the study. The overall game concept and realization were well received by the target group. Study participants did have various and creative ideas for the further development of {KIJANI}. The majority ( n = 16) thought that using {KIJANI} would increase their {PA} level. User experience based on the {UEQ} scale was (mean ± {SD}): attractiveness (1.78 ± 1.82), perspicuity (2.15 ± 0.680), efficiency (0.67 ± 1.25), dependability, (1.21 ± 0.93), stimulation (1.24 ± 1.78), and novelty (1.27 ± 1.34). Conclusion With these insights, a further step has been taken in the participatory development of {KIJANI}. Apps like {KIJANI} appear to be suitable for {PA} promotion in children and adolescents.},
