	abstract = {Background: There is an increased need for physical activity among children and adolescents. {KIJANI}, a mobile augmented reality game, is designed to increase physical activity through gamified exercises. Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to get feedback on the design and implementation of potentially physical activity-increasing features in {KIJANI}. Methods: A mixed-method study (n=13) evaluates newly implemented game design features quantitatively through measuring physical activity and qualitatively through participant feedback. Results: Preliminary results are limited and need further studies. Participants’ feedback shows a positive trend and highlights the game’s potential effectiveness. Conclusion: {KIJANI} shows potential for increasing physical activity among children and adolescents through gamified exercise. Future work will refine the game based on user feedback and findings presented in related work. The game’s long-term impact is to be explored.},
