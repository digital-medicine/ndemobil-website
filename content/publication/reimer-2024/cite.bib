	abstract = {Background
              Mobile health ({mHealth}) apps can be used for cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) prevention. User-centered design, evidence-based content and user testing can be applied to ensure a high level of usability and adequate app access.
            
            
              Objective
              To develop and evaluate an {mHealth} app ( {HerzFit}) for {CVD} prevention.
            
            
              Methods
              {HerzFit}´s development included a user-centered design approach and guideline-based content creation based on the identified requirements of the target group. Beta testing and a preliminary usability evaluation of the {HerzFit} prototype were performed. For evaluation, German versions of the System Usability Scale ({SUS}) and the {mHealth} App Usability Questionnaire ({GER}-{MAUQ}) as well as free text feedback were applied.
            
            
              Results
              User-centered design thinking led to the definition of four personas. Based on their requirements, {HerzFit} enables users to individually assess, monitor, and optimize their cardiovascular risk profile. Users are also provided with a variety of evidence-based information on {CVD} and their risk factors. The user interface and system design followed the identified functional requirements. Beta-testers provided feedback on the structure and functionality and rated the usability of {HerzFit}´s prototype as slightly above average both in {SUS} and {GER}-{MAUQ} rating. Participants positively noted the variety of functions and information presented in {HerzFit}, while negative feedback mostly concerned wearable synchronization.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The present study demonstrates the user-centered development of a guideline-based {mHealth} app for {CVD} prevention. Beta-testing and a preliminary usability study were used to further improve the {HerzFit} app until its official release.},
