	abstract = {Objective
              In Germany, only a few standardized evaluation tools for assessing the usability of mobile Health apps exist so far. This study aimed to translate and validate the English patient version for standalone apps of the {mHealth} App Usability Questionnaire ({MAUQ}) into a German version.
            
            
              Methods
              Following scientific guidelines for translation and cross-cultural adaptation, the patient version for standalone apps was forward and back-translated from English into German by an expert panel. In total, 53 participants who were recruited as part of the beta testing process of the recently developed {mHealth} app {HerzFit}, answered the questions of the German version of the {MAUQ} ({GER}-{MAUQ}) and the System Usability Scale. Subsequently, a descriptive as well as a psychometric analysis was performed to test validity and reliability.
            
            
              Results
              After conducting three cognitive interviews, five items were modified. The values for Cronbach alpha for the entire questionnaire and the three subscales (0.966, 0.814, 0.910, and 0.909) indicate strong internal consistency. The correlation analysis revealed that the scores of the {GER}-{MAUQ}, the subscales and the {SUS} were strongly correlated with each other. The correlation coefficient of the {SUS} and the {GER}-{MAUQ} overall score was r = 0.854, P {\textless} 0.001 and the coefficients of the subscales and the {SUS} were r = 0.642, P {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.866, P {\textless} 0.001 and r = 0.643, P {\textless} 0.001.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We have developed a novel German version of the {MAUQ} and demonstrated it as a reliable and valid measurement tool for assessing the usability of standalone {mHealth} apps from the patients’ perspective. The {GER}-{MAUQ} allows a new form of standardized assessment of usability of {mHealth} apps for patients with cardiovascular disease in Germany. Further research with a larger sample and other samples is recommended.},
