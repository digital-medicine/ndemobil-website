abstract: Background
              Identifying high-risk individuals is crucial for preventing cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}). Currently, risk assessment is mostly performed by physicians. Mobile health apps could help decouple the determination of risk from medical resources by allowing unrestricted self-assessment. The respective test results need to be interpretable for laypersons.
            
            
              Objective
              Together with a patient organization, we aimed to design a digital risk calculator that allows people to individually assess and optimize their {CVD} risk. The risk calculator was integrated into the mobile health app {HerzFit}, which provides the respective background information.
            
            
              Methods
              To cover a broad spectrum of individuals for both primary and secondary prevention, we integrated the respective scores (Framingham 10-year {CVD}, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 in Older Persons, and Secondary Manifestations Of Arterial Disease) into a single risk calculator that was recalibrated for the German population. In primary prevention, an individual’s heart age is estimated, which gives the user an easy-to-understand metric for assessing cardiac health. For secondary prevention, the risk of recurrence was assessed. In addition, a comparison of expected to mean and optimal risk levels was determined. The risk calculator is available free of charge. Data safety is ensured by processing the data locally on the users’ smartphones.
            
            
              Results
              Offering a risk calculator to the general population requires the use of multiple instruments, as each provides only a limited spectrum in terms of age and risk distribution. The integration of 4 internationally recommended scores allows risk calculation in individuals aged 30 to 90 years with and without {CVD}. Such integration requires recalibration and harmonization to provide consistent and plausible estimates. In the first 14 months after the launch, the {HerzFit} calculator was downloaded more than 96,000 times, indicating great demand. Public information campaigns proved effective in publicizing the risk calculator and contributed significantly to download numbers.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The {HerzFit} calculator provides {CVD} risk assessment for the general population. The public demonstrated great demand for such a risk calculator as it was downloaded up to 10,000 times per month, depending on campaigns creating awareness for the instrument.
